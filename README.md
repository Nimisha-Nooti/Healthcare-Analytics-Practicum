# Predicting Covid-19 High Risk Counties Across NY State 
This project analyzes the intersection of healthcare utilization, COVID-19 burden, and social determinants of health (SDOH) across counties in New York State. Using data from SPARCS (hospital discharges), the U.S. Census (ACS), CDC SVI index, and NY State COVID-19 APIs, we created an integrated dataset to identify high-risk counties for COVID-19 spread and health system strain.

Key components include:

Data cleaning and standardization across multiple public datasets

Feature engineering (e.g., hospitalization per 100k, positivity rate, SVI scoring)

Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost) to classify high-risk counties

Visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots, Tableau dashboard) for insight communication

This analysis supports data-driven public health decisions, with potential for use in targeted interventions, policy planning, and health equity research.
